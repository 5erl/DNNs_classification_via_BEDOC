### Deep Neural Networks Classification via Binary Error-Detecting Output Codes

This repository makes available all trained neural networks published in the paper and part of source codes by which
results presented in Table 4 are possible to replicate. Training is not published due complexity of source code because
history of development is included and printed on quality and comprehension.
